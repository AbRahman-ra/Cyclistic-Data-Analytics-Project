## Scenario

Cyclistic's stakeholders realized the main source income for the company is the annual memberships registered by their members. However, the casuals (who use bikes for single times without memberships) are very low compared to the members (next page).

### Questions:

- How does the casual usage differ from the member?
- How can we generate actionable insights to attract more casuals?
